# sentiment_analysis_stock_market
Testing grounds to decipher if there is a correlation with stocks/company headline news data, and associated price increase or decrease. 

This python program is not statistically perfect in terms of a wide array of data being collected; however it is a starting ground for building a database of stocks news headlines and basic sentiments analysis of those headlines. 

Future improvements will include wider webs-craping across multiple data sources. Once there is sufficient data, the correlation analysis will hopefully be more statistically significant.
